# Part 3

## Debugging

1. The bug is that the values being saved from the inputs are strings which when added together are just concatenated into a new string. 
2. I would fix it by typecasting the inputted values to Numbers so that when calculateSum is called, it will be adding to numbers instead of concatenating strings.
