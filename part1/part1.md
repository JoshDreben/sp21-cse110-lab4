## Part 1a

1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. returns error as result is out of scope
5. returns error cause const variable isn't mutable
6. returns error cause it's out of scope

## Part 1b

1. prints 3 because i is within the function scope
2. prints 150 because discounted price is within function scope
3. prints 150 because finalPrice is an implicit var
4. this function returns a list of discounted prices from a given list of
   previous prices and a discount percentage
5. returns error as i isn't defined in that scope
6. returns error as discountedPrice isn't defined in that scope
7. prints 150 because finalPrice is in function scope
8. This function also returns a list of discounted prices
   from the given list of prices and discount percentage
9. Will throw an error cause i isn't within function scope
10. returns 3 because it's the length of the provided list and is within

11. returns a list of discounted prices of a given list of prices and given discount percentage
12.
   - student.name
   - student['Grad Year']
   - student.greeting()
   - student['Favorite Teacher'].name
   - student.courseLoad[0]
13.
   - '32', this is string concatentation
   - 1, treats 3 as a number cause there is no minus on strings
   - 3, null is nothing
   - '3null' treats null as string
   - 4, true is treated as 1
   - 0, false and null treated as 0's
   - '3undefined', undefined treated as a string
   - NAN, doesn't know what to do with string and undefined
14. 
   - true, 2 is greather than one
   - false, string for 2 is greater than 12
   - true, weak comparison treats both as equal
   - false, strong comparison shows the two objects are unequal
   - false, true treated as 1
   - true, treats 2 as a boolean
15. == first takes both operands and makes them the same type before comparing, === doesn't convert the operands, only checking for strong equality


17 - This returns a new array [2, 4, 6]. The function iterates through the given array pushes the result of calling doSomething, which doubles it's input, into the new returned array.
